## Exam Topics

### Observability Concepts (18%)
1. pull-based

2. Monitoring: continues observation of a system to detect and alert on abnormal behavior.
2. Telemetry: automates collection and transmission of data from remote source.

12. timely and proactive data collection (real-time or near real-time) / pushing into the centralized data system
13. InfluxDB is a pull-based time-series database designed to handle high volumes of time-stamped data (IoT, Sensor, Analytics).

30. YAML and JSON

### PromQL & Metrics (28%)

4. Instant Vector
5. `predict-linear()`
6. `boolean`
7. `avg_over_time(metrics[x])`

9. `rate(...)` needs COUNTER type metrics
10. `offset` refers to the past time as duration
11. `rate(...)` calc avg rate of change of a time series over the specified time range, `irate(...)` calc avg rate of change of a time series at the last 2 data points
